The default settings for the PHP error log file vary from operating system to system. The location of the error log file itself can be set manually in the php.ini file. On a Windows server, in IIS, it may be something like `error_log = C:\log_files\php_errors.log` in Linux it may be a value of `/var/log/php_errors.log`.
